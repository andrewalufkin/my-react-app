This is a simple README to help keep track of progress and work that I want to do on the app!

Recent progress:
* Added likes and dislikes and undos for posts. Modified posts so that they show the name of the poster. 
* Added Home page
* Updated Home Page to fetch user's posts and show them

TODO:
* Add feed prioritization. Prioritize stuff based on likes, dislikes, user preference, & sentiment value. (Positive sentiment means higher priority.)
* Add color customization 
* Add cookies to keep users logged in and remember their color preference.
* Add customizable homepage where users can add status, a profile picture, and more like myspace
* Add 1 hr requirement (Although I may not keep that restraint, we'll see)
* Add some kind of point system. Users get points when they invite friends.
* Host properly on AWS again
* That's enough for now but when all of that is done you can brainstorm more stuff!
